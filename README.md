# Power-BI-Project
Analyzing Attrition of an Organization

Tools Used:     Power Query, Power Bi, DAX (To find measure using Data Analytics Expressions)

Goal of this project

The goal of this project was to analyze the attrition rate of a company and identify the various factors contributing to it. To achieve this, we utilized Power BI, a data visualization and analysis tool, to create an interactive dashboard that could provide insight into the company's attrition rate.


Data Collection and Preparation:  (Using Power Query)

I started by collecting data from various sources such as HR databases, performance management systems, and employee surveys. We then cleaned and prepared the data by removing any duplicates, filling in missing values, and categorizing data into different groups.

Data Analysis:
I then used Power BI to create a dashboard that would display key metrics related to employee attrition. We created various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, doughnuts and tables that displayed information such as:


Employee demographics: age, gender, education, job level, and department
Employee performance: salar
Attrition rate: overall and by department, job level, and tenure

I also used Power BI's drill-down feature to provide deeper insights into the data. For example, users could drill down to see the attrition rate by department and then further drill down to see the attrition rate by job level within that department.


Data Visualization:
Finally, I created a dashboard that displayed all the visualizations I created. The dashboard was interactive, allowing users to filter the data based on different parameters such as department, job level, and tenure. This allowed users to quickly identify patterns and trends related to employee attrition.


Conclusion:
The final product was a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that allowed the company to gain insight into their attrition rate and identify factors contributing to it. The company could then take steps to address these factors and reduce their attrition rate.
